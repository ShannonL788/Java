# Casino Dice Game

A game in a casino involves rolling two six-sided dice. To win, the sum of the two dice must be either 7 or 11. 
We use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the percentage probability of winning, rounded to the nearest percent.

## Features

- Rolls two dice and checks if the sum is 7 or 11.
- Runs the simulation a number of times (default: 10,000).
- Outputs the probability of success as a percentage.
