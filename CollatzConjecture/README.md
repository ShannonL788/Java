# Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It 
asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform 
every positive integer into 1.  

The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer 
is chosen to start the sequence.  
The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.95Ã—1020, but no 
general proof has been found. 

## Features

The simple arithmetic operations are as follows:  
- If the number is even, the next term is half of the number
- If the number is odd, the next term is 3 times the number plus 1.
